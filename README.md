researchdesigneR is a collection of structured documents to guide clinicians designing clinical research studies as well as data scientists conducting the respective analyses. Rather than a book, the researchdesigneR's goal is to serve as a decision support system, where you can get information on (1) the clinical situations where a given method might be useful, (2) what types of variables are required to run that method, (3) how the method works, and (4) how to interpret the results coming from the method.

* description: problem - large number of approaches in the analysis of patient data, little time to learn them; a lot of literature, but what we need is a decision support system
template-based, searchable, SEO, potentially connected to solr
* use cases:
   - design: meetings, plan for projects, grant proposals, journal clubs
      * start question
      * start data
      * start methods
   - api - solr, rstudio integration; figures concept map
* template: methods, data, plots
* motion graphic - how to search - gif web page, ag repo (within section) with code examples
* todo 
* contributing - clone send, pull request; wiki
